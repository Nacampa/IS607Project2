# IS607 - Project 
# Neil Acampa

# Project 2: Profiling a Data Set
# 1 - Choice of Data Set: Selected the adult.data set from 
# URL: archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/adult/adult.data

#2 - Analyis requirements:
#    Include an analysis of each variable. Summarize and identify questionable variables

#   I selected the folowing attributes from the data table (df)
#   "Age","Level of Education","Marital-Status","Occupation","Race","Gender","Country","Income"

#   I created a new data frame called dfproject. Various types output will be created from dfproject
     
#   dfoutput  = dfproject ordered by age, level of educatioion, race and gender
#   output1   = group dfoutput by age, level of education and income
#   output2   = group dfoutput by age, level of education, gender and income
#   output3   = group dfoutput by age, level of education, race and income

#    (add charts and posible regression)
#    Needs more work
